## Newport News Shipbuilding Climate Change Impact Prediction Tool

This repository houses code, documentation, and rubric information for a VCU Capstone Project. Newport News Shipbuilding (NNSB) has prompted us with the task of creating a system that will predict how climate change will impact their operations. The main focus of this tool is the prediction of how various climate factors will impact the Newport News area and in tern impact operations at the ship yard.

Our answer to this challenge was to create this Climate Change Impact Prediction Tool (CCIPT). By factoring in local data gathered all around the southern chesapeake bay region, our system creates several regressive models to predict future climate conditions. These models include analysis on sea level, tide, storm surge, and land subsidence data in the Newport News area.
