1.4)List of issues, problems, or concern(s)

- _It should be mentioned in this document that we have not yet been able to meet with our sponsor due to his schedule. 
  It is important to understand that this effected our project's start by roughly 3 weeks. - Sponsor_
  
- _The base software is ridiculously robust and is going to take a lot of time to be able to manipulate to our specific needs.
   That being said, without contact from our sponsor and us flying blind on what those needs are, it makes
   it very difficult to have concrete goals as we also have to research the research topic to see what we exactly want to have     as deliverables. - Sponsor_

- _Problem – team member accoutable_
