| 1 |   |   | M | Predict Climate Change Impacts on NNSB Operations | NNSB wants the information to be able to understand what the potential impacts of climate change are on shipbuilding, port facilities, and infrastructure. |
|   | 1.1 |   | M | GIS Map | The main deliverable will in the form of an interactive GIS map. |
|   |   | 1.1.1 | M | Software Research/Selection | The team will research current GIS applications and make an informed decision on which environment and software will provide the best use case for our project. |
|   |   | 1.1.2 | M | Data Requirements Definition | The team will identify key data areas that have relevance to NNSB&#39;s project scope. |
|   |   | 1.1.3 | M | Data Gathering | The team will gather the appropriate data from various sources as needed. |
|   |   | 1.1.4 | M | Data Utilization | The team will utilize a static data repository (objectives defined in Functional Req 1.2) in order to drive the predictive models. |
|   |   | 1.1.5 | M | Model Generation | The team will implement dynamic predictive models that are based on the collected data. The models should support each input type in the data. |
|   |   | 1.1.6 | M | Predictions | The team will implement an input-based prediction system that utilizes the previously made models to estimate the water level given various conditions. |
|   |   | 1.1.7 | M | Interactivity | The team will implement functionality that will allow users to change information such as year prediction and various storm scenarios. |
|   |   | 1.1.8 | M | Integration | The team will implement a system to convert the water level prediction into a GIS layer that can then provide visual feedback to the user. |
|   | 1.2 |   | M | Data Repository | To accompany the main deliverable a data repository will house all relevant information used to drive the simulation. |
|   |   | 1.2.1 | M | Database Research/Selection | The team will identify suitable database software solutions for the software. |
|   |   | 1.2.2 | M | Data Storage Formatting | The team will design and develop a schema for storing all of the relevant data in an efficient manner. |
|   |   | 1.2.3 | S | Repository evolution | The team will develop input tools that allow for easy data source additions to be made to the static repository. |
| 2 |   |       | S | Define stretch goals | The team will define further stretch goals to improve the system. |
