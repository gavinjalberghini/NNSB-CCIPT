## Science Museum of Virginia Meeting Notes

- Look into VITA LIDAR Dataset
    - Used for costal monitoring
    - Over the next several years storm surge will be the most impactful area to look into  
    
<p>&nbsp;</p>

- Digital elevation model (use the LIDAR)
- Costal Tide Gages
    - Look into water level changes  

<p>&nbsp;</p>

- Norfolk Flood day projection 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

- William V. Sweet 
    - Potential POC and has data pertaining to 
    - Patterns and Projections of High tide flooding along the us coastline using common impact threshold
    - Report num 86

<p>&nbsp;</p>

- Stress points to consider
    - Long term water level impact
    - Hurricane storm surge

<p>&nbsp;</p>

- Tide Gauge
- JSON Sat Imagery on water height

<p>&nbsp;</p>

- Ocean Volume Increase
    - Ocean temp
    - Melting Ice
    - Virginia Landmass Is sinking down due to a lack of weight in the upper North American continent
        - USGS is monitoring the isostatic adjustment
            - USGS Subsidence Chesapeake Bay paper detailing
            - Eggleston and Pope
        - As ground water is expended it expedites the process of the Virginia landmass moving lower to sea level
